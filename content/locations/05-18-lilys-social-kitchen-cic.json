  "description": "#foodwithasocialbite   We are a not for profit organisation with two missions in our local communities.  One to provide employment and showcase the employability, skills and talents of groups marginalised from accessing paid employment.  This includes people with learning disabilities and/or autism, serving or ex offenders, those who have been vulnerably housed and long term unemployed.   Secondly to work with Fareshare Kent to utilise food surplus either in our commercial settings or in our food parcels, recipe boxes and pay as you can afford cafes.   Our trainees work to prepare fresh, tasty food in our wholesale, catering and public cafes.  During covid 19 our focus is much more in working to ensure our local communities have access and skills to have wholesome, nutritional food and our commercial business supports the FREE food parcels and ready meals we work to prepare. Order via website. "
