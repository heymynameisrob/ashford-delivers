  "description": " Although Biddenden Vineyards may be closed to visitors currently, their online shop with the full range of wines, ciders & juices remains open, so you can still enjoy Biddenden at home!  Kent’s original vineyard, Biddenden has been producing wines for over 5 decades and boasts an award-winning range of still & sparkling wines, including their signature wine, Biddenden Ortega, a medium, fruity white wine.  But it’s not just wines made at the family run business!  Biddenden Cider, a strong Kentish cider, is made on site from local apples, which are also used to produce Biddenden’s farm pressed juices - ideal those looking for an non-alcoholic option.  The full range is available for delivery both locally to your door and nationwide at www.biddendenvineyards.com. "
