  "description": "Kent Food Hubs runs and supports local online markets that make supermarkets pointless. This is where you can buy and sell food and other products and simply live a better life for the 21st century. We sell food either produced in Kent or from ethical wholesale, from local traders. Order via our website by noon on a Tuesday (no min spend) and pick up, or have your food delivered on Thursday covering postcodes TN23-TN30."
