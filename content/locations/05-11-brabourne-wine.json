  "description": "We're a boutique, family-run vineyard just outside Ashford in the small village of Brabourne. Currently we have just one wine on sale - a crisp, dry, still Rose, made purely from Pinot Noir grapes, perfect for a hot summer's day. During lock-down we're offering free delivery within ten miles of the vineyard.  Order via the website shop."
