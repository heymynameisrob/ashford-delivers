  "description": "We are a traditional country pub that do very good quality food.  When Covid 19 struck, we decided to take some of our traditional dishes off our menu. ie fish and chips, steak burger wrap, roast dinner and much more and serve them up for our locals. We deliver by car within a 10 mile radius of the pub. There is no delivery charge or minimum spend.  We also do collection."
