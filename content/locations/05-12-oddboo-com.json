  "description": "In a modern world of computer games and plastic toys, ODDBOO offers an alternative! ​I started making the Bunny BOOs for my daughters in 2016. To my surprise, my daughters’ little friends wanted their own BOOs too and their parents valued the quality and interactive play characteristics of our handmade fabric dolls. Hence ODDBOO was born!  We involve children in the design process of our BOOs and their outfits. Our SUPER BOOs were designed by children!  Our bunnies' quality and charm show in every last detail. Every BOO looks different. Children love to dress them in different themed outfits, especially in pyjamas for bedtime cuddles. They also like to write ODDBOO stories, which they frequently share with us.  We deliver beautifully put together presents directly to your loved ones. We even add a little handmade tag with your lovely messages to each bunny. ​ OUR BUSINESS MODEL: TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL WOMEN ESPECIALLY MUMS OUR MOTTO: TO ENCOURAGE CHILDREN AWAY FROM COMPUTERS & SCREENS. Order online or by phone."
