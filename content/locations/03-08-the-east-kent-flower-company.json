  "description": "The East Kent Flower Company is a local business that was set up initially as an Event and Wedding florist by Louise Courtenay, and has created a real buzz in the wedding industry for the quality of its event flowers. If you are looking for gorgeous, quality florals with excellent service, we would be delighted to help. We recently opened a new flower shop in Wye. Open for ‘Click & Collect’ and online sales. We are also taking telephone orders for full florist services (including funerals and weddings) and we will be stocking gifts.  When the national restrictions on the opening of non-essential retail is lifted on 12th April, the shop will open for normal opening hours."
